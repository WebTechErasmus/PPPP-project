        <p>Aquatint is an intaglio <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>making technique, a variant of etching that produces areas of tone rather than lines. For this reason it has mostly been used in conjunction with etching, to give both lines and shaded tone.[1] It has also been used historically to <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> in colour, both by <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>ing with multiple plates in different colours, and by making monochrome <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s that were then hand-coloured with watercolour.</p>

        <p>It has been in regular use since the later 18th century, and was most widely used between about 1770 and 1830, when it was used both for <mark class ="artist" style = "background:none;">artist</mark>ic <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s and decorative ones. After about 1830 it lost ground to lithography and other techniques.[2] There have been periodic revivals among <mark class ="artist" style = "background:none;">artist</mark>s since then.[3] An aquatint plate wears out relatively quickly, and is less easily reworked than other intaglio plates. Many of Goya's plates were reprinted too often posthumously, giving very poor impressions.[4]</p>
        <p>Among the most famous <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s using the aquatint technique are the major series by Goya, many of The Birds of America by John James Audubon (with the colour added by hand), and <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s by Mary Cassatt <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>ed in colour using several plates.</p>

        <p class = "subtitle" ><h3>Technique</h3></p>
        <p>In intaglio <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>making techniques such as engraving and etching, the <mark class ="artist" style = "background:none;">artist</mark> makes marks into the surface of the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink. The plate is inked all over then wiped clean to leave ink only in the marks. The plate is passed through a <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>ing press together with a sheet of paper, and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks, so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs. This is repeated many times. Like etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant (acid) to etch into the metal plate. Where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines, aquatint uses powdered rosin (resin) to create a tonal effect. The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating; where the grains are will <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> white, with black areas around. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. The rosin is then washed off the plate before <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>ing.</p>

        <p class = "captions" > Goya, No. 32 of Los Caprichos (1799, Por que fue sensible). This is a fairly rare example of a <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> entirely in aquatint. </p>
        <p>Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> as an even and fairly dark tone of ink. The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> a lighter shade. Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker. Occasionally the two techniques of aquatint and mezzotint are combined.</p>

        <p>A variety of early experiments aimed to add tonal effects to etching included the first use of a resin dust ground by the painter and <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>maker Jan van de Velde IV in Amsterdam, around 1650. However none of these developed a technique that caught on with other printmakers.[7] Experimentation by several artists with somewhat different techniques reached a peak after about 1750, and as they were initially very secretive, the <mark class ="history" style = "background:none;">history</mark> of the emergence of the standard technique remains unclear.</p>

        <p>Various claimants include the Swede Per Floding working with the Frenchman François-Philippe Charpentier in 1761, J. B. Delafosse in 1766, working with the amateur Jean-Claude Richard (often rather misleadingly known as the Abbé de Saint-Non) in 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince in 1768–69. Le Prince was more effective than the others in publicizing his technique, publishing Découverte du procédé de graver au lavis in 1780, though he failed to sell his secret in his lifetime. It was bought posthumously by the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1782, who released it on an open basis.[9]</p>
        <p>Though England was to become one of the countries using the technique most, the earliest English aquatints were not exhibited until 1772, by the cartographer Peter Perez Burdett. It was taken up by the watercolourist Paul Sandby, who also seems to have introduced technical refinements as well as inventing the name "aquatint".[10] In England <mark class ="artist" style = "background:none;">artist</mark>s such as Sandby and Thomas Gainsborough were attracted by the suitability of etched outlines with aquatint for reproducing the popular English landscape watercolours, which at this period usually also had been given an initial outline drawing in ink. Publishers of <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s and illustrations for expensive books, both important British markets at the time, also adopted the technique. In all these areas, a <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model, with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint.[11] After the French Revolution, one of the most successful publishers in London, the German Rudolf Ackermann, had numbers of French refugees working on the floor above his shop in The Strand in London, each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table.</p>
        <p>Over the same period in France there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>ing using multiple plates, which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint (or mezzotint) for tone. <mark class ="artist" style = "background:none;">Artist</mark>s included Jean-François Janinet and Philibert-Louis Debucourt, whose La Promenade Publique is often thought the masterpiece of the style.[13] Another branch of this French movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks. This was at first led by Jacob Christoph Le Blon (1667–1741), who very nearly anticipated modern CMYK colour separation and then carried on by his pupil Jacques Fabien Gautier d'Agoty and later members of the d'Agoty family until around 1800.</p>
        <p>Goya, maker of incontestably the greatest <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark>s using aquatint, probably learned of the technique through Giovanni David from Genoa, the first significant Italian to use it. Goya used it, normally with etching and often burnishing and other techniques, in his great <mark class ="print" style = "background:none;">print</mark> series Los Caprichos (1799), Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810–1819), La Tauromaquia (1816) and Los disparates (c. 1816–1823).</p>
