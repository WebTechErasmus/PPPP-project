        <p>Woodblock <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> or block <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> is a technique for <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> on textiles and later paper. Each page or image is created by carving a wooden block to leave only some areas and lines at the original level; it is these that are inked and show in the print, in a relief <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> process. Carving the blocks is skilled and laborious work, but a large number of impressions can then be printed.</p>

        <p>As a method of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 AD. Woodblock <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> existed in Tang China by the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> books and other <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s, as well as images, until the 19th century. Ukiyo-e is the best-known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> images on paper are covered by the art term woodcut, except for the block books produced mainly in the 15th century.</p>

        <p>According to the Book of the Southern Qi, in the 480s, a man named Gong Xuanyi (龔玄宜) styled himself Gong the Sage and "said that a supernatural being had given him a 'jade seal jade block writing,' which did not require a brush: one blew on the paper and characters formed."[1] He then used his powers to mystify a local governor. Eventually he was dealt with by the governor's successor, who presumably executed Gong.[2] Timothy Hugh Barrett postulates that Gong's magical jade block was actually a <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> device, and Gong was one of the first, if not the first printer. The semi-mythical record of him therefore describes his usage of the <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> process to deliberately bewilder onlookers and create an image of mysticism around himself.[3] However woodblock print flower patterns applied to silk in three colours have been found dated from the Han dynasty (before AD 220).[4</p>

        <p>The rise of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> was greatly influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. According to Mahayana beliefs, religious <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s hold intrinsic value for carrying the Buddha's word and act as talismanic objects containing sacred power capable of warding off evil spirits. By copying and preserving these <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s, Buddhists could accrue personal merit. As a consequence the idea of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> and its advantages in replicating <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s quickly became apparent to Buddhists, who by the 7th century, were using woodblocks to create apotropaic documents. These Buddhist <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s were printed specifically as ritual items and were not widely circulated or meant for public consumption. Instead they were buried in consecrated ground. The earliest extant example of this type of printed matter is a fragment of a dhāraṇī (Buddhist spell) miniature scroll written in Sanskrit unearthed in a tomb in Xi'an. It is called the Great spell of unsullied pure light (Wugou jingguang da tuoluoni jing 無垢淨光大陀羅尼經) and was printed using woodblock during the Tang dynasty, c. 650–670 AD.[5] A similar piece, the Saddharma pundarika sutra, was also discovered and dated to 690 to 699.[6]</p>
        <p>This coincides with the reign of Wu Zetian, under which the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, which advocates the practice of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> apotropaic and merit making <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark>s and images, was translated by Chinese monks.[5] The oldest extant evidence of woodblock prints created for the purpose of reading are portions of the Lotus Sutra discovered at Turpan in 1906. They have been dated to the reign of Wu Zetian using character form recognition.[5] The oldest <mark class ="text" style = "background:none;">text</mark> containing a specific date of <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> was discovered in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang in 1907 by Aurel Stein. This copy of the Diamond Sutra is 14 feet long and contains a colophon at the inner end, which reads: "Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]". It is considered the world's oldest securely dated woodblock scroll.[5] The Diamond sutra was closely followed by the earliest extant printed almanac, the Qianfu sinian lishu (乾符四年曆書), dated to 877.[5]</p>

        <p>Evidence of woodblock <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> appeared in Korea and Japan soon afterward. The Great Dharani Sutra (Korean: 무구정광대다라니경/無垢淨光大陀羅尼經, romanized: Muggujeonggwang Daedharanigyeong) was discovered at Bulguksa, South Korea in 1966 and dated between 704 and 751 in the era of Later Silla. The document is printed on a 8 cm × 630 cm (3.1 in × 248.0 in) mulberry paper scroll.[7] A dhāraṇī sutra was printed in Japan around AD 770. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by Empress Shōtoku. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the Hyakumantō Darani (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").[5][8]</p>
        <p>Woodblock <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> spread across Eurasia by 1000 AD and could be found in the Byzantine Empire. However <mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> onto cloth only became common in Europe by 1300. "In the 13th century the Chinese technique of block<mark class ="printing" style = "background:none;">printing</mark> was transmitted to Europe",[9] soon after paper became available in Europe.</p>
