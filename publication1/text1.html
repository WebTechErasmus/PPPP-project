        <p>Context: The identification and evaluation of activities capable of dislodging calyceal renal calculi require a patient surrogate or validated functional pyelocalyceal renal mode</p>
        <p>Objective: To evaluate roller coaster facilitation of calyceal renal calculi passage using a functional pyelocalyceal renal model.</p>
        <p>Methods: A previously described adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and remolded to function as a patient surrogate. Three renal calculi of different sizes from the patient who provided the original computed tomographic urograph on which the simulator was based were used. The renal calculi were suspended in urine in the model and taken for 20 rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The roller coaster rides were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, model position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage.

        </p>
        <p>Conclusion: The functional pyelocalyceal renal model serves as a functional patient surrogate to evaluate activities that facilitate calyceal renal calculi passage. The rear seating position on the roller coaster led to the most renal calculi passages.</p>

        <p>In the United States each year, more than 300,000 patients seek emergency department care for kidney stones, or renal calculi. 1 Patient positional inversion, hydration, and external application of force to the body wall has been used to facilitate renal calculi</p>
        <p>passage with variable success.2-5 Reports of spontaneous renal calculi passage associated with bungee cord jumping and roller coaster riding have been published in the foreign lay press.6 The lifetime prevalence of kidney stones in men is approximately 11% and in women, 6%.1</p>
        <p>Over several years, a notable number of our patients reported passing renal calculi spontaneously after riding the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida. The number of stone passages was sufficient to raise suspicions of a possible link between riding a roller coaster and passing renal calculi. One patient reported passing renal calculi after each of 3 consecutive rides on the roller coaster. Many patients reported passing renal calculi within hours of leaving the amusement park, and all of them rode the same roller coaster during their visit.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the current study was to validate this functional pyelocalyceal renal model and to provide clinical recommendations based on data generated</p>

        <p>Functional pyelocalyceal renal model (silicone) modified from a validated ureteroscopy and renoscopy surgical simulator.</p>
        <p>A high-fidelity adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and evaluated as a potential patient surrogate to study variables associated with renal calculi passage (Figure 1).7,8 The behavior of the renal calculi within the pyelocalyceal renal model mimicked the clinical experience and outcomes as reported by patients anecdotally as well as according to the physiologic behavior of renal calculi in the calices. The simulator was adapted by remolding it in clear silicone to create a functional pyelocalyceal renal model able to permit direct inspection of calculi movement within the calyceal system (Figure 2). The ureter and partial bladder components of the Ideal Anatomic simulator were removed during the modification process to facilitate sealing the hollow portion of the renal component. The sealed model contained 3 calcium oxalate calculi with volumes of 4.5 mm3, 13.5 mm3, or 64.6 mm3 suspended in urine. The renal calculi used in this study had been spontaneously passed from the patient whose computed tomographic urogram scan was used to create the original pyelocalyceal renal cast model.</p>
        <p><The roller coaster had twin tubular steel rails and it did not go upside-down. The maximum speed was 35 mph, and the model was subjected to sharp turns and quick drops during the ride, which lasted 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The roller coaster was made up of a railway train engine with no passenger seating and 5 passenger cars with 3 rows of seats and 2 to 3 passengers abreast in each car (Figure 3). While riding on the roller coaster, the pyelocalyceal renal model was seated in an anatomic position inside a padded backpack held against the back of the seat at renal height between the researchers./p>
        <p>The renal calculi were loaded into the calyceal system of the clear functional pyelocalyceal renal model, and their positions were documented. After each ride, the position of each stone was recorded and renal calculi were repositioned as needed. The renal calculi were positioned into their calyceal locations using rotation, external compression of the functional pyelocalyceal renal model, and direct percutaneous needle manipulation. A renal calculus was recorded as passed if it moved from a starting location in a renal calyx into the trap at the level of the ureteropelvic junction.</p>
        <p>The pyelocalyceal renal model containing 3 calculi was taken for 20 rides on the roller coaster during the 2008 amusement park season. Seat assignment on the roller coaster was random and determined as a function of place in the waiting line. Stone distribution within the model was allocated so a renal calculus occupied each calyx during the trial.</p>
        <p>Care was taken to protect and preserve the enjoyment of the other guests at the park. Before the park’s Guest Services consented to our research project, researchers agreed to abide by the park’s tenets of safety, show, courtesy, and efficiency.</p>
        <p class="subheadings"><h2>Results</h2></p>
        <p>A total of 60 renal calculi rides on the roller coaster were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, renal model position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage. The functional pyelocalyceal renal model contained 3 renal calculi and completed 20 rides (Table 1 and Table 2).</p>
        <p>Raw data were gathered from the front seating (cars 1-3, rows 1-7) and rear seating (car 5, rows 13-15) of the roller coaster. Renal calculi were distributed within the pyelocalyceal renal model to provide data from all calyxes and calculi volumes. In 8 rides, the model was placed in the front seating (cars 1-3, rows 1-7), and in 12 rides, the model was placed in the rear seating (car 5, rows 13-15).</p>

        <p>Roller coaster seating for the functional pyelocalyceal renal model containing renal calculi suspended in urine</p>
        <p>The overall renal calculi passage rate in the front seating of the roller coaster, regardless of renal calculi volume or calyceal location, was 4 of 24 (16.67%). The overall renal calculi passage rate in the rear seating of the roller coaster, regardless of renal calculi volume or calyceal location was 23 of 36 (63.89%).</p>
       
        <p class="subheadings2"><h3>4.5-mm3 Renal Calculus</h3></p>
        <p>When starting in the lower calyx of the functional pyelocalyceal renal model, the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus passed to the ureteropelvic junction region in 1 of 3 rides. Although starting 1 time in the upper calyx and 4 times in the middle calyx, the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus never passed out of the calyx in which it was initially placed. The overall passage rate of the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus in the roller coaster’s front seating was 1 of 8 rides.</p>
        <p class="subheadings2"><h3>13.5-mm3 Renal Calculus</h3></p>
        <p>When starting in the middle calyx of the functional pyelocalyceal renal model, the 13.5 mm3 volume renal calculus passed to the ureteropelvic junction region in 1 of 2 rides. Although starting 1 time in the upper calyx and 5 times in the lower calyx, this renal calculus never passed out of the calyx in which it was initially placed. The overall passage rate of the 13.5- mm3 renal calculus in the roller coaster’s front seating was 1 of 8 rides.</p>
